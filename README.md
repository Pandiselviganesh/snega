  ABSTRACT
Zomato’s tagline – “Never have a bad meal”. It serves as a comprehensive encyclopedia of restaurants, replete with ratings, average pricing, menus, and reviews. It is currently the only app of its kind in India. To keep the people entertained, they even have a streaming service with roughly eighteen original series. Zomato just focuses on food. It also intends to include everything from restaurant discovery to delivery in its value chain. Coming to the backstory of Zomato….in the year 2008, one day Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chandah were waiting in the line for lunch in their cafeteria with their coworkers, it happened. They observed the lengthy line and considered how much time would be saved if customers could order their food online rather than waiting in line. They posted a few images of the cafeteria’s menu on the business website as a result. Soon many workers began placing online orders rather than visiting to the cafeteria directly. Originally known as Foodie bay, it is now called Zomato.










Chapter 1
Introduction of study
1.1 Introduction of Online Food Delivery
Online food ordering is the process of food delivery or takeout a local restaurant or food cooperative through a web page or  app.Much like consumer goods many of these services allow customers to keep accounts with them in order to make frequent ordering convenient. A customer will search for a favorite restaurant, usually filtered biotype and choose from available items, delivery or pick- up. Payment can be amongst others either by credit debit card, online payment or cash, with the restaurant returning a percentage to the online food company. The e-services market segment Online Food Delivery contains the user and revenue development of two different delivery service solutions for prepared meals:
(1) Restaurant-to-Consumer Delivery
(2) Platform-to-Consumer Delivery Revenue includes the gross merchandise value (GMV) which is defined as the total sales dollar value for merchandise/food sold through the Online Food Delivery marketplace.
    Online Food Delivery comprises services which deliver prepared meals and food that was ordered online for direct consumption. The Restaurant-to-Consumer Delivery segment includes the delivery of meals carried out directly by the restaurants. The order may be made via platforms or directly through a restaurant website (e.g., Domino's,).
     The Platform-to-Consumer Delivery market segment focuses on online delivery services that provide customers with meals from partner restaurants that do not necessarily have to offer food delivery themselves. In this case, the platform (e.g., Zomato, Swingy, UberEATS) handles the delivery process.
1.2 Introduction of the Industry
1.2.1 History of Online Food Delivery Industry
The first online food order was a pizza from Pizza Hut in 1994. The first online food ordering service, World Wide Waiter (now known as Waiter.com), was founded in1995. The site originally serviced only northern California, later expanding to several additional cities in the United States. By the late 2000s, major pizza chains had created their own mobile applications and started doing 20-30% of their business online. With increased smartphone penetration, and the growth of both Uber and the sharing economy, food delivery startups started to receive more attention. Instacart was founded in 2012. In2013, Seamless and Grub hub merged. By 2015, online ordering began overtaking phone ordering. As of September 2016, online delivery accounted for about 3 percent of the 61 billion U.S. restaurant transactions.
1.2.2 Online Food Service in India

The revolution in this sector began in 1996 with the opening up of restaurants by McDonald’s, Pizza Hut, and Domino’s followed by Subway,
Haldimand’s, Moti Mahal and Barbeque Nation etc. E-commerce in India is expected to grow from US $2.9 billion in2013 to a mammoth US $100 billion by 2020, making it the fastest growing e-commerce market in the world!

COMPANY PROFILE
2.1 Introduction of company
Zomato is a restaurant search and discovery app and website, providing in-depth information about restaurants.

In addition to restaurant search and discovery, it has expanded its offering to include Online Ordering, Table Reservations, a WhitelabelPlatform and a Point-of-Sale system, creating the technology to connect restaurant businesses and customers.
2.2 History of Brand Zomato
Zomato, which started as Foodie Bay, was established in July 2008 by two IITDelhi alumnus, Deepener Goyal, and Pankaj Chadha. The idea struck Deepinderwhen his colleagues consistently had a demand for paper menu leaflets of different restaurants, to order food. That's when he thought of converting these restaurant paper menus into a digital app, which is far more accessible and easier to use. The online food delivery space in India is dominated by two big players- Zomato and Swiggy. There are other players like Food panda, Just Eat, Tasty Hana and Food Mingo but the competition for the No 1 position is majorly confined between Zomato and Swiggy, backed by big global investors and a large user base. Zomato started as the website Foodiebay.com, by Deepener Goyal, a post-graduate from IIT Delhi. Foodie bay officially started in July 2008 with a list of 1,200restaurants in the Delhi NCR region. This database expanded to 2,000 restaurants by end 2008. Expanded its reach to Kolkata, Mumbai, Bangalore and Pune within the next six months That is when Info Edge (India), the parent company of the Naukri.comgroup, invested 4.7 crore (US$1 million) in the business. In November 2010, Foodiebay.com was renamed Zomato.com. The brand name was changed due to a possible move outside of the food vertical and also to avoid a possible conflict with eBay, because the earlier brand name Foodie bay contained ‘eBay ‘in it. 

Funding:
Between 2010 and 2013, Zomato received its biggest funding of approximately USD 16.7million (INR 167, 000, 00) from “Info Edge India”. This gave them a 57.9% stake in the company.

The total funding of Zomato by the beginning of 2015, was a promising USD 113 million. In 2015, along with the 3 initial investors, Temasek- a Singapore based investment company, AL pitched, bringing in USD 110 million f or that year.2016 was a slow year for the company in terms of funding, but 2017 picked the pace up again with
WhatsApp’s adding to the list of investors and raising a conservative USD 20 million. This racked up the total funding of Zomato to USD 223.8million since its founding in 2008.With the most recent rounds of funding, things started looking peachy for the company in March 2018, especially with Alibaba’s Ant Financial coming into the picture with a whopping USD 150 million. 
Acquisitions:
Zomato has acquired 12 startups globally. In July 2014, Zomato made its first acquisition by buying Menu-mania for an undisclosed sum. The company pursued other acquisitions such as lunchtime.cz and obedovat.sk for a combined US$3.25 million.

Growth:
As funding started picking up the pace in 2010 Zomato’s presence across India did too.
 By 2011 the company after establishing a monopoly in Delhi NCR  moved to cities like Pune, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Ahmadabad. It kept pace with the smartphone boom too, by introducing its mobile app at this point in time.

LITERATURE REVIEW
(Hult K. K., December 2005): The results of this study provide good support for the relationships between customer perceptions of service/Product quality, Product freshness, Site easiness, Time saving, and their continued loyalty to both the channelandthe particular brand. The evidence clearly shows a longitudinal relationship between higher perceptions and increased loyalty. The data provide important insights for researchers and managers interested in developing and perfecting methods for retaining customers in the dynamic arena of Internet retailing. The application of behavioral models of this type is generalizable, given that most Internet retailers have some type of ongoing data-collection system for surveying customers regarding their satisfaction with various aspects of the transaction. While the models developed in this article are specific to the two companies and the online grocery industry, the general approach should generalize fairly easily because companies generally have substantial investments in information technology ofthe type necessary to support such behavioral modeling.
(Jenvild, 2014) : According to the research Indian consumers are demanding more take-away and home-delivery services. There is much unpenetrated scope in this market, and successful operators should apply the new preferences and trends in an innovative manner when developing their home-delivery services. Indians are extremely active online, and social media marketing is very effective for this market. Consumers from all social groups are identifying with each other under the umbrella of nationalism, Operators have a gold enhance to exploit this phenomenon when attempting a strategy to appeal cross-segments. Indian tastes call for more experimentation. Consumers experience little difference of outlets, and thus will not develop brand loyalty without more differentiation in the market. India wants more health and hygiene. Higher education and increased lifestyles diseases has created awareness of importance of health. The demands and supplies of “healthy “products will continue to grow at a fast rate.
